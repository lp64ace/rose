 *
 * This is a memory allocator module, this was created for tracking and tackling
 * memory problems. Such memory problems include the following;
 *
 *  - Double free.
 *  - Out of bounds writes.
 *  - Memory leaks.
 *
 * These all introduce extra time complexity and also space complexity increase
 * during allocation and deallocation of memory blocks so guarded memory
 * allocation should only be activated during Debug mode.
 *
 * For Release targets lockfree allocator should be used instead.
