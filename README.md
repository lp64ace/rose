# Rose

Cross-platform library that enables easy customizability of the application during both runtime and develop-time.
It's the fact that there are limits that make life interesting, wouldn't it be boring to be able to do ANYTHING, 
it would definately be scary!

## Quick Information

Rose aims to be a software development tool that allows easy development and management of an application both in runtime and develop-time.
